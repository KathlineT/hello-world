learning the hello world thing
Hi all
I am a lover of all things rocks and crystals. I like Tarot and Oracle cards. 
I worked at the same job for almost 20 years until they decided during Covid to cut costs.
I have 3 Collies and my mom now has 2 that I gave her as a Covid present to keep herself occupied.
I am married with 2 kids who still live at home even though they are old enough to move the heck out.
I live a fairly unspectacular life.
Enough about me.
